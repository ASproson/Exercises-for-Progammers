# TipCalculator GUI (React, TypeScript, Tailwind)

Implement the [tipCalculator](https://github.com/ASproson/Exercises-for-Progammers/blob/main/javascript/tipCalculator.ts) program as a GUI program that automatically updates the values when any value changes 

Instead of the user entering the value of the tip as a percentage, have the user drag a slider that rates satisfaction with the server, using a range between 5% and
20%
