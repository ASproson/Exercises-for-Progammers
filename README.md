# Exercises for Progammers

Exercises taken from [Brian Hogan's Exercises for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers/). The goal of this repo is to complete all 57 challenges, optimizing for Big O along the way and detailing the decisions between preferring space over time and vice versa. Additionally there will be a focus on using TypeScript, and, later on, converting and making use of other languages.

To auto-compile on save:

`tsc -w`
